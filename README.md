During the Level 3 Data Technician Bootcamp, an extra credit task assigned to me featured on answering some questions and writing queries in relation to using the Join Method in SQL. See below the images of the queries that were written. After research into enabling how ot use then I ended up coming up with these solutions to answer the query related questions. In the future I hope I can develop my understanding of SQL to become more proficient in this method. The Join method links two pieces of information from individual tablesets within the  RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. The attached files show my answers to this extra credit attempt to further develop my SQL skills there and here are the screenshots below.

****Figure 1** :  The countrycode questions in this extra task to test further understanding and stretch and challenge of SQL knowledge which involved three tasks. It was important to note that the respective primary and foreign keys that each table had refer to the unique indicator of each tableset that was used, so the join is between these two sets, once the join is performed with the unique indictators, the answers once the # is removed that undoes the blue in the answers if ran with the database loaded into the SQL server whichI cannot save as a file, so I can ony show you my answers, links those two tables together so that the pieces of information come together from each table, thus answering the question.
